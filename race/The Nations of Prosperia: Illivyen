You may use your action to attempt to grapple a target with one of these tendrils. If you grapple a target they are restrained and have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. You can't use the same tendril on another target. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 17; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Having a destroyed tendril deals no damage to you and you can extrude a replacement tendril on your next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it. While in dim light or darkness, you can take a Hide action as a reaction. You can't manifest your tendrils while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your tendrils might be destroyed when you manifest them.",
