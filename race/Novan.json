					"Awakened golems are living constructs brought into being through incredible magic. Unmoored from the connection to their creator, an awakened golem is free to make its own decisions, pursue its own ambitions, and live its own life, though it is still blessed (or perhaps burdened) with the astonishingly powerful, ageless body of a construct.",

						"entries": [
							"Few spellcasters have the power, the ingenuity, and the motive to literally create life from nonliving materials ― even the gods find that task challenging. Life spontaneously created by magic normally sputters out as the spell the created it fades, or otherwise vanishes completely in a puff of smoke at the spell's conclusion. Creating a true awakened golem, therefore, is a herculean feat.",
							"Creating a golem first requires a manual of golems, a vast amount of wealth, a deep well of arcane power, and patience. When it is at last complete, the golem towers above even its creator, possesses incredible strength, and is perfectly obedient to its creator's wishes. But not all arcanists desire blind obedience from their creations, and then undergo the equally challenging task of awakening the golem, imbuing it with sapience and perhaps even a soul. Often, the awakening transforms the golem on some physical level as well, bringing it closer to the scale of humanoids and giving it more recognizable features.",
							"Sometimes awakened golems are created by sheer accident, such as through a mishap with the creation process, a wild magic event gone terribly wrong, or a card drawn from a deck of magical cards. In these cases, an awakened golem might not resemble a traditional golem at all, and will likely learn all it knows from the environment it is born into."

							"Like other creatures, most awakened golems resent taking orders day in and day out. They can think and act for themselves and relish the chance to see the world, if afforded it.",
							"Still, most awakened golems feel separate from the rest of the world. Other humanoids might recognize them as being intelligent and sapient, but a wide division stands between them and polite society. Lingering questions about the golem's creation, from the nature of their souls, to the issue of their agelessness, couples with this and tends to alienate them further, often positioning them as outcasts left to aimlessly find their way in the world."

						"name": "Awakened Golem Names",

							"An awakened golem's name depends on their origin: if a golem was made by an arcanist, its name would have been granted to it when it was first created; if it was brought to life spontaneously, it likely chose its own name or had one foisted upon it by those around them. Golems might choose to express a gender, but are not created with any disposition toward one, and so might equally pick a male, female, or unisex name.",
